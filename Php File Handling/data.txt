PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It is widely used for creating dynamic web pages and can be embedded directly into HTML.

Key Points:
- PHP is easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.
- It supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
- PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML.

PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and has since evolved into a robust language used by millions of websites worldwide.
